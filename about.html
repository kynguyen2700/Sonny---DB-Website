        <h1>About the creator</h1>
        <p class="about__desc">This is a project created by Kevin Nguyen out of his love for using discord. Kevin loves the ability that discord gives user to allow them to talk and hang out with his friend from around the world and with his desire to learn new skills, he began creating a discord bot. The idea for the bot is derived from the fact that being from Texas where the weather is unpredictable sometimes, 
            so Kevin wanted to create a discord bot that can provide the current weather forecasts for cities around the world using the Open Weather API.
            Along with this, Kevin wanted to share it with the world by creating a website that people can use to learn about and invite Sonny to their discord servers for their own personal use. Kevin plans to develop and add more functionality to Sonny while also learning how to integrate new technology and languages into his project. 
        </p>

        <p><i>A special thanks to Belle/Adorrebel, who designed the icon for Sonny!</i></p>
